Iâ€™m a postdoc researcher [Eric Alm group](http://almlab.mit.edu) in the Biological Engineering department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research focuses on investigating the microbiome from a genome-centric approach. During my PhD, I work with [Tami Lieberman](http://http://lieberman.science/) to study the evolutionary history of Bacteroides fragilis within the gut of healthy human subjects. Currently, I am working on creating large-scale strain collection from a broad human population. This living strain collection could help us better understand the principles governing microbial population genetics, and provides the appropriate materials for study microbial gene functions.
